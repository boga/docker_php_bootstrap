# docker_php_bootstrap
Project template for web development.
Includes PHP, MySQL (actually, MariaDB), Xdebug (debugger and profiler) and Adminer.

Usage:
- `XDEBUG_REMOTE_PORT` and `port` of Listen for XDebug in VS Code debug config should be same
- `/var/www/html` should have be pointed to project root ("${workspaceRoot}" works for now).
